    <p>Hi, my name is Alex Franklin</p>
<p>I am in information technology student at the University of Missouri. I currently have two years of school left and hope to specialize in cyber security! This is the end of my second semester at Mizzou and it has treated me well so far. I have created this webpage for my final project in IT-1000. I am still a bit new to coding so the site is a bit basic, but you should have no issues bavigating between pages.</p>
<p>Use these links to acess other pages on my website!</p>
